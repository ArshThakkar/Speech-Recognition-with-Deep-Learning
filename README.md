## Speech Recognition with Deep Learning
This project aims to transcribe spoken language into text using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the power of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, our model can accurately convert audio signals into textual representations.

### Overview

Speech recognition has become an essential technology in various applications, including virtual assistants, transcription services, and voice-controlled devices. Our project focuses on building an efficient and accurate speech recognition system using deep learning methods.

### Key Features

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: The model is based on the DeepSpeech 2 architecture, which combines convolutional layers for feature extraction and recurrent layers for sequence modeling.
  
- **LJSpeech Dataset**: We use the LJSpeech dataset, which contains high-quality speech recordings from a single speaker reading passages from various texts. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets.
  
- **CTC Loss Function**: The model is trained using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, which allows the model to learn from sequences of varying lengths without the need for alignment.
  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We evaluate the performance of our model using the Word Error Rate (WER), a standard metric for measuring the accuracy of transcription systems. Additionally, we provide sample predictions to visualize the model's output.
